 Litigence, Inc. | Full Stack Web Development Internship
Welcome to My GitHub ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Computer Systems Engineering student at the University of Georgia.

Iâ€™m particularly interested in:

Full Stack Development: Building robust, user-friendly applications that integrate well with back-end systems.
Data Processing & Automation: Leveraging technology to streamline complex workflows, a skill I developed through my experience managing large data sets and automation in my previous roles.
Scalability & Performance Optimization: Ensuring applications are efficient and can handle growing user demand.
Iâ€™m excited about the opportunity to contribute and learn from the talented team at Litigence, Inc. Feel free to explore my projects, and I look forward to growing as a developer!

Here's a project I worked on years ago. It's a UNO Game made with python and it runs through the console.
